              <p>
                There is no magic snake oil here, its a simple substitution cipher.  Here is how the algorithm works:
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li> An MD5 hash of the chart selection phrase is performed and the first 4 bytes of the hash is used<br>
                     as a random number seed to a Mersenne Twister pseudo-random number generator.
                <li> The password chart is then filled using sequences of 1 to 3 random upper and lower case letters and<br>
                     optionally numbers and punctuation by grabbing successive numbers generated from the Twister.<br>
                     The reason for the random sequence length is to make reversing the substitution cipher a bit harder.
                <li> The alphanumeric characters in the password is then converted using the chart.
              </ol>
              <p>
                I offer no proof that the method of generating the chart is "secure".  It is really just meant as a<br> 
                simple and fun substitution cipher that will help people maintain a little more secure set of passwords.<br>
